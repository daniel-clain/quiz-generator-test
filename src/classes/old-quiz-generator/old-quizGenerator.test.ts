1
Q. What is the want
A. People want to thoroughly know and understand things relative to their goals and interests

2
Q. Why is the want
A. Knowledge is power. Knowing and understanding things opens up new opportunities for you and allows you to persue your goals. The opposite is true, people dont like feeling powerless and weak from being ignorant. Knowledge and understanding strengthens you and gives you confidence and reassurance that in the event of being faced with adversity or threat.

3
Q. What would be ideal in achieving the want
A. To aquire it in the most time effective value with no compromise to the quality. Also factoring in how enjoyable the procedure is.

4
Q. What problems are faced
A. Peoples minds struggle to retain new information. When someone learns something new, they can easily forget it, especially if it is complex, especially if it has been a long time since it was learnt, especially if it is boring. Peoples minds have evolved to filter out things that arent important and only retain things that are. Things that are deemed important, from an evolution perspective, are relative to survival. Peoples emotions are relative to survival, that is why generally people have a better chance of remembering things if they were in a strong emotional state at the time. The emotional magnitude of the event forges a deeper neural pathway, the deeper the path, the more accessible and familiar the memory is. For more unemotional things, even if you want to learn them, most of the time your mind will will allow it to slip. Thus the goal of gaining knowedge and understanding of particular targets isnt as easy or effective as an ideal situation would be.

5
Q. What is the strategy for overcoming the problem
A. Although level of importance is relative to how deeply imprinted neural pathway is on the mind. This is not the only thing that causes imprints on the mind. Another thing is repetition. Each time you do the same thing, the more familiar it becomes. To go further into detail and outline the neuances. The longer you go without a repitition the, the more your neural pathway will fade, and ease in which it takes to recall the knowledge will decline. The more frequently you repeat, the easier it will be to recall the knowledge and you will be able to do the next repitiion with more clarity and ease. However, there is a threshold where repitition can be excessive and the time effective value will no longer be worth it. For example, you could learn to tie your shoe laces, and then repeat, each time getting better at it and more confident and effective. But there reaches a point where maybe if youve tied your shoe laces 100 times in 20 minutes, that each additional time isnt translating to a worthwile benefit. And thus repetition can reach an excessive threshold where you are no longer getting quality time effective value and it is no longer worth your time. However, another example to juxtapose the last. Say for example you learnt to play the harp, and you played every day, all day for 6 months. Lets assume playing the harp is so challenging that it takes 6 months to get to the point where you are at a point where youve reached the time effective value threshold, and now you finally know at least 95% of the knowledge and understanding of playing the harp. The point is, what if after 6 months, you then never played the harp for 10 years, and then you picked it up again. Even though you had done the highest level of repetitive practice in that 6 month period, it has now been 10 years. Your mind and memory have had 10 years for that neural pathway to fade. I suspect its possible that you may not have completely forgotten everything, however it would be obvious to state that at that 10 year mark, your knowledge, understanding and familiarity would have been nothing compared to the last day of that 6 month repetitve practice period. The main point is, even though regular repetitve practice is the strategy, there should be a rational schema in place to help derive the most time effective value. My initial theory is some sort of opposite to exponential (logarithmic), where in the early stages of learning something new, that is the time to do the most frequent itterations of practice and re learning. But then, the more times youve done it correcly, the less often you need to repeat. So for example, if you want to know how to make a cheese-cake, in the first week you should make the cheese cake 5 times, then in the second week 2 times, then in the 4th week 1 time, then again a month later, then again 4 months later, then again 1 year later. The idea is that your getting great time effective value, and after 2 years, you wont have made a cheese cake for a while, but youll still be very good at it.

6
Q. What is the design for implementing the strategy
A. A web app that you enter in things you want to know and understand in the form of questions and answers. You think of a question that will best test your understanding, and a matching answer that best answers the question. On regular basis, you run a quiz, of say 10 questions, the question you enetered will be asked, you attempt to answer the question, after you answer you reveal the correct answer, and then you mark yourself correct or inccect. The more often you get a question right, the less chance it will have of being asked again, the more you get a question wrong, the higher chance it will have of being asked again. Importantly though, the probability a question will be asked will be also weighted by how it has been since the last question was asked. For example, a question that was asked yesterday and has been answered correctly 1 out of 10 times may have the same probability of being asked as a question that has been answered correctly 9 out of 10 times if the last time the question was asked was 3 months ago. Even though you probably most certainly know the answer the 2nd question, the app is re indenting your neural pathway by making you answer the same question again, and if you get it right a 10th time, then maybe that question now wont be asked again for another 6 months. The app will be designed to constantly indent neural pathways on things you want to know in the most time effective value way there is. Therefore coming as close as possible to the ideal way of achieving the knowledge and understanding we want.
